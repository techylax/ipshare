# IP SHARE

IP Share is a file transfer app to PC via WiFi. All the files can be accessed by any device connected to the same WiFi network. IP Share helps you to share files, videos, and photos. Sharing files does not need any mobile data. It can also share files to a PC via WiFi hotspots.

## Installation

The easiest way to build is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Once installed, then you can import the project into Android Studio:

Download
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/techylax/ipshare

```
```bash
Open File
Import Project
Select build.gradle under the project directory
Click OK
Then, Gradle will do everything for you.
  
```
You might find that your device doesn't let you install your build if you already have the version from Google Play installed. This is standard Android security as it it won't let you directly replace an app that's been signed with a different key. Manually uninstall GitHub from your device and you will then be able to install your own built version.

You can find my app online on Google Play Store.Make sure to check it out.
